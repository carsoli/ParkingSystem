# ParkingSystem
This is a parking system with the help of a chatbot, it will guide people to park at the best parking spot they can park in and help them reserve a spot to park in. Our parking system prototype is design with 4 parking spaces, each parking space has an object detection sensor and RGB led that indicates the status of a parking spot. So here is how it works, when a driver enters a parking area, he communicates over telegram with our chatbot, the chatbot gets the driver the nearest spot to the entrance from which the driver is entering from (in case of parking areas that have multiple entrances). The parking sensors are connected to the Arduino, which every 5 second sends a request to the server with latest updates on the parking slots and the server replies to the Arduino the requests for reserving a spot (if any). In case we have a request for a certain spot the RGB led turns blue for approx. 2 mins waiting for a car to park, if the driver does not show up after 2 mins, the parking spot status returns to available and the led turn green.
